    "\"\"\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python is used for creating and managing threads in a program\n",
    "\n",
    "1. activeCount()\n",
    "The activeCount() function is used to retrieve the current number of active threads in a program. \n",
    "It returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. An active thread refers to a thread that has been created and has not yet completed or been terminated. \n",

    "The currentThread() function returns the Thread object representing the current thread of execution. It can be used to obtain information about the currently executing thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. enumerate()\n",
    "The enumerate() function returns a list of all active Thread objects currently alive in a program. \n",
    "Each Thread object represents an active thread. \n",
    "This function is useful when you want to retrieve a list of all running threads and perform operations on them collectively. \n",
    "It allows you to iterate over the active threads, inspect their attributes, or perform other thread-related operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "key difference between activeCount() and enumerate() is that activeCount() provides a simple count of active threads, whereas enumerate() returns a list of Thread objects, allowing you to access detailed information about each thread.\n",

    "1. run()\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the run() method is a standard method defined in the Thread class of the threading module. The run() method represents the code that will be executed when a thread is started using the start() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. start()\n",
    "The start() method is used to start the execution of a thread. It creates a new thread of execution and calls the run() method of the thread. The start() method initializes the thread and then invokes the run() method in a separate thread of execution. It allows multiple threads to run concurrently, performing their designated tasks. It's important to note that start() should be called only once per thread object; calling it multiple times will raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. join()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The join() method is used to ensure that a thread completes its execution before the program continues to execute further. When the join() method is called on a thread, it causes the calling thread to wait until the target thread has finished executing. This is particularly useful when you want to synchronize the execution of multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. isAlive()\n",
    "The isAlive() method is used to check if a thread is currently active or alive. It returns True if the thread is still running or has not yet completed its execution, and False otherwise. \n",

    "\n",
    "Multithreading allows for the concurrent execution of multiple tasks. This can enhance the responsiveness of an application, especially in cases where tasks involve waiting for external resources or user input. While one thread is waiting, other threads can continue executing, preventing the application from becoming unresponsive.\n",

    "Disadvantages of Multithreading: \n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of Synchronization: When multiple threads share resources or data, careful synchronization is required to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency-related issues.\n",
    "Improper synchronization can lead to unpredictable and hard-to-debug issues.\n",

    " \n",
    "Deadlocks can occur when four necessary conditions are met:\n",

    "Mutual Exclusion: The resources involved cannot be simultaneously accessed or shared by multiple threads.\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A thread holds a resource and waits for another resource at the same time.\n",
