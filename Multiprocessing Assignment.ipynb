    "Increased Performance: Multiprocessing allows you to distribute the workload across multiple processes, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and improving the overall performance of your application. \n",
    "It can be particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks, where the performance gains from parallelism can be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Execution: By utilizing multiple processes, you can execute computationally intensive or time-consuming tasks concurrently, taking advantage of the available CPU cores. \n",
