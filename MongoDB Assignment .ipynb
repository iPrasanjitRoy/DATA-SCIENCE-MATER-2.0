    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use \n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database. \n",
    "It is designed to store and manage unstructured and semi-structured data, such as JSON-like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational Databases:\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, provide an alternative approach to data storage and management compared to traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "Some key characteristics of non-relational databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: Non-relational databases often prioritize performance and can handle large volumes of data and high write/read workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: Non-relational databases allow for dynamic and flexible schemas, meaning that each record or document can have a different structure or set of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB, being a document-oriented NoSQL database, is preferred over SQL databases in certain scenarios:\n",
    "Unstructured or Semi-structured Data: If your data is complex and doesn't fit neatly into a table-like structure, MongoDB's document model can efficiently handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB's architecture supports easy scalability across multiple servers, making it suitable for applications that require high scalability and distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between MongoDB and SQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application. \n",
    "SQL databases, with their structured schemas and rich query capabilities, may still be the preferred choice for applications that require complex relationships, ACID transactions, or extensive data integrity constraints.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB, a popular document-oriented NoSQL database, offers several key features that differentiate it from traditional SQL databases. \n",
    "Here are the important features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Model:\n",
    "MongoDB uses a flexible document model for data representation. Data is stored in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability and High Performance:\n",
    "MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. \n",
    "It can handle large volumes of data and provides high throughput for both read and write operations. Sharding, replication, and auto-sharding features facilitate easy scalability and data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with Programming Languages:\n",
    "MongoDB provides native drivers and libraries for various programming languages, making it easy to integrate MongoDB with applications. \n",
    "It offers official drivers for popular languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and more. This wide range of language support makes MongoDB accessible and convenient for developers.\n",
